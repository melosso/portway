## üß© Key Features

Portway is built with flexibility and control in mind. Whether you're proxying services or exposing SQL endpoints, this API gateway adapts to your infrastructure with secure, high-performance routing. Configuration can be done quickly by setting up a minimum amount of configuration files.

* **Multiple endpoint types**: Endpoints can be set up easily for various purposes. They can also be grouped together or kept separate by using namespaces.

  * **SQL Server** ‚Äî direct CRUD access with schema-level control and documentation
  * **Proxy** ‚Äî forward to internal services; supports complex orchestration
  * **File System** ‚Äî read/write from local storage or cache
  * **Webhook** ‚Äî receive external calls and persist data to SQL
  * **Static** ‚Äî read static files or set up a mock endpoint
* **OData query support**: Filter, select, sort, and paginate data using standard OData v4 query parameters (`$filter`, `$select`, `$orderby`, `$top`, `$skip`)
* **Auth system**: Token-based, with Azure Key Vault integration
* **Environment-aware routing**: All your environments can be isolated and configured
* **Built-in documentation**: Every endpoint is documented out of the box
* **Comprehensive logging**: Request/response tracing, including live monitoring (configurable)
* **Rate limiting**: Easy to configure, protects downstream systems

In other words, Portway is an open-source API gateway that's easily configured, but is built with common application requirements in mind.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Before deploying Portway, make sure your environment meets the following requirements. These ensure full functionality across all features, especially SQL and authentication.

* [.NET 9+ Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)
* IIS (production hosting) if hosting on Windows (preferred)
* SQL Server access (for SQL endpoints)
* Local filesystem access for configuring/running the application

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Portway up and running in your environment. Setup is fast and modular, making it easy to configure just what you need.


### 1. Download & Extract

Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/melosso/portway/releases) and extract it to your deployment folder. It already includes a set of example environment and endpoint configurations.

---

#### **Alternative: Docker Compose (Recommended for Home Lab)**

You can quickly deploy Portway using Docker Compose and the official image:

```yaml
services:
  portway:
    image: ghcr.io/melosso/portway:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./environments:/app/environments
      - ./endpoints:/app/endpoints
      - ./tokens:/app/tokens
      - ./log:/app/log
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      - PORTWAY_ENCRYPTION_KEY=YourEncryptionKeyHere
      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:8080
```

Then run:

```sh
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

This will start Portway on port [8080](#) and mount your configuration folders. Adjust paths and ports as needed for your environment.

### 2. Configure Your Environments

Define your server and environment settings to isolate dev/staging/prod as needed. These configs are used across endpoints and logging.

**`environments/settings.json`**

```json
{
  "Environment": {
    "ServerName": "localhost",
    "AllowedEnvironments": ["prod", "dev"]
  }
}
```

**`environments/prod/settings.json`**

```json
{
  "ServerName": "localhost",
  "ConnectionString": "Server=localhost;Database=prod;Trusted_Connection=True;Connection Timeout=5;TrustServerCertificate=true;"
}
```

### 3. Define Your Endpoints

Endpoints are configured as JSON files. Each type has its own directory and format, making them easy to manage and extend.

#### SQL Endpoint ‚Äî `endpoints/SQL/Products/entity.json`

Exposes a SQL table with restricted columns and CRUD operations. Use column aliasing (> 2025.10.0) to prevent exposing sensitive field names.

```json
{
  "DatabaseObjectName": "Items",
  "DatabaseSchema": "dbo",
  "PrimaryKey": "ItemCode",
  "AllowedColumns": ["ItemCode;ProductNumber", "LongDescription;Description", "Assortment;AssortmentCode", "sysguid;InternalID"],
  "AllowedEnvironments": ["prod", "dev"]
}
```

#### Proxy Endpoint ‚Äî `endpoints/Proxy/Accounts/entity.json`

Acts as a reverse proxy for internal services with full method control.

```json
{
  "Url": "http://localhost:8020/services/Exact.Entity.REST.EG/Account",
  "Methods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "MERGE"],
  "AllowedEnvironments": ["prod", "dev"]
}
```

#### Composite Endpoint ‚Äî `endpoints/Proxy/SalesOrder/entity.json`

Combines multiple calls into a single logical transaction for APIs requiring sequential or nested operations.

```json
{
  "Type": "Composite",
  "Url": "http://localhost:8020/services/Exact.Entity.REST.EG",
  "Methods": ["POST"],
  "CompositeConfig": {
    "Name": "SalesOrder",
    "Description": "Creates a complete sales order with multiple lines and header",
    "Steps": [
      {
        "Name": "CreateOrderLines",
        "Endpoint": "SalesOrderLine",
        "Method": "POST",
        "IsArray": true,
        "ArrayProperty": "Lines",
        "TemplateTransformations": {
          "TransactionKey": "$guid"
        }
      },
      {
        "Name": "CreateOrderHeader",
        "Endpoint": "SalesOrderHeader",
        "Method": "POST",
        "SourceProperty": "Header",
        "TemplateTransformations": {
          "TransactionKey": "$prev.CreateOrderLines.0.d.TransactionKey"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Static Endpoint ‚Äî `endpoints/Static/ProductionMachine/entity.json`

Serves static content (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.) with optional OData filtering support.

```json
{
  "ContentType": "application/xml",
  "ContentFile": "summary.xml",
  "EnableFiltering": true,
  "AllowedEnvironments": ["prod", "dev"]
}
```

#### Files Endpoint ‚Äî `endpoints/Files/Documents/entity.json`

Stores and serves files such as documents, images, or data files.

```json
{
  "StorageType": "Local",
  "BaseDirectory": "documents",
  "AllowedExtensions": [".pdf", ".docx", ".xlsx", ".txt"],
  "AllowedEnvironments": ["prod", "dev"]
}
```

#### Webhook Endpoint ‚Äî `endpoints/Webhooks/entity.json`

Used for receiving and storing webhook payloads directly into your database.

```json
{
  "DatabaseObjectName": "WebhookData",
  "DatabaseSchema": "dbo",
  "AllowedColumns": ["webhook1", "webhook2"]
}
```

### 4. Prepare your Deployment

If you're choosing to deploy the services on Windows, please make sure to prepare your environment: you'll need to safely store the application encryption key. On containerized environments, this can be done with the identically named PORTWAY_ENCRYPTION_KEY variable.

```powershell
# Immediately stores the encryption key to your System Environment Variables
$bytes = New-Object byte[] 48; [Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::Create().GetBytes($bytes); [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PORTWAY_ENCRYPTION_KEY", [Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes), "Machine")
```

### 5. Deploy

When you're ready to host your application in IIS, there are a few important things to keep in mind. If you plan to use a proxy, you'll need to configure the correct user identity to ensure everything works smoothly. Don't forget to double-check that your application pool and security settings are properly configured for production use - we're assuming you already have the fundamentals of website security covered.

> [!TIP] 
>  If you're using a **Proxy** setup, make sure you explicitly change the Application Identity. It's also worth taking some time to fine-tune your application pool and website settings to maximize uptime and strengthen your security policies. For additional guidance on security best practices, you might find [Security Headers by Probely](https://securityheaders.com/) helpful.

## üîê Auth & Security

### Token-Based Authentication

Portway uses a lightweight token-based system for authentication. Tokens are machine-bound and stored securely on disk.

```bash
Generated token for SERVER-1: <your-token>
Saved to /tokens/SERVER-1.txt
```

Include the token in request headers, with the Bearer prefix included:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

> [!CAUTION] 
> The generated token files are highly sensitive and pose a significant security risk if left on disk. **Remove these files immediately after securely saving your token elsewhere.** Unauthorized access to these files can compromise your environment.

### Azure Key Vault Support

To centralize and secure configuration secrets, use Azure Key Vault. Portway can read secrets automatically by environment.

```powershell
$env:KEYVAULT_URI = "https://your-keyvault-name.vault.azure.net/"
```

Secrets format: `{env}-ConnectionString` and `{env}-ServerName`

### Protecting Secrets

Portway automatically encrypts sensitive data in your environment settings files on startup. Connection strings and sensitive headers (containing words like "password", "secret", "token", etc.) are encrypted using RSA + AES hybrid encryption to keep your data safe at rest.

## üì° API Examples

Here are some common requests you'll make using Portway's endpoints.

### SQL

Query specific data with full OData support:

```http
GET /api/prod/Products?$filter=Assortment eq 'Books'&$select=ItemCode,Description
```

### Proxy

Forward calls to internal REST services:

```http
GET /api/prod/Accounts
POST /api/prod/Accounts
```

### Composite

Chain together multiple operations into one:

```http
POST /api/prod/composite/SalesOrder
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "Header": {
    "OrderDebtor": "60093",
    "YourReference": "Connect async"
  },
  "Lines": [
    { "Itemcode": "ITEM-001", "Quantity": 2, "Price": 0 },
    { "Itemcode": "ITEM-002", "Quantity": 4, "Price": 0 }
  ]
}
```

### Static

Serve static content with the (optional) OData filtering:

```http
GET /api/prod/ProductionMachine?$top=1&$filter=status eq 'running'
Accept: application/xml
```

### Files

Depending on your configuration, you could upload, list, and download files.

```http
POST /api/prod/files/Documents
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
file=@report.pdf
```

List files:
```http
GET /api/prod/files/Documents/list
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

Download a file:
```http
GET /api/prod/files/Documents/abc123fileId
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Webhooks

Receive data from external services:

```http
POST /api/prod/webhook/webhook1
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "eventType": "order.created",
  "data": {
    "orderId": "12345",
    "customer": "ACME Corp"
  }
}
```

You'll find comprehensive configuration examples in our [documentation page](https://portway-docs.melosso.com/).

## üìî Documentation

We allow you to expose the API with a configurable documentation endpoint. This can be disabled if necessary. 

### Interactive documentation
The application uses [Scalar](https://github.com/scalar/scalar) to render your OpenAPI specification as interactive API documentation. Access it at `/docs` to explore endpoints, test requests, and view response schemas, which are all generated automatically from your endpoint configurations. If necessary, the (deprecated) `/Swagger` route is also available (after configuration).

### Schema discovery
Portway automatically generates API documentation by reading your database schema at startup. It connects to the first allowed environment listed for each SQL endpoint to retrieve column metadata. If you're using Windows Authentication (`Trusted_Connection=True`), ensure your IIS Application Pool identity has the appropriate permissions on all environment databases. With SQL Authentication, each environment uses its own credentials.

## üìä Logging & Monitoring

Portway provides visibility into its operations with detailed logs and health check endpoints.

* Logs stored under `/log` with daily rotation
* Auth logs included for auditing
* Health endpoints:

  ```http
  GET /health
  GET /health/live
  GET /health/details
  ```
