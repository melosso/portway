Ready to go? Then lets continue:

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Portway up and running in your environment. Setup is fast and modular, making it easy to configure just what you need.


### 1. Download & Extract

Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/melosso/portway/releases) and extract it to your deployment folder. It already includes a set of example environment and endpoint configurations.

---

#### **Alternative: Docker Compose (Recommended for Home Lab)**

You can quickly deploy Portway using Docker Compose and the official image:

```yaml
services:
  portway:
    image: ghcr.io/melosso/portway:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./environments:/app/environments
      - ./endpoints:/app/endpoints
      - ./tokens:/app/tokens
      - ./log:/app/log
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:8080
```

Then run:

```sh
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

This will start Portway on port [8080](#) and mount your configuration folders. Adjust paths and ports as needed for your environment.

### 2. Configure Your Environments

Define your server and environment settings to isolate dev/staging/prod as needed. These configs are used across endpoints and logging.

**`environments/settings.json`**

```json
{
  "Environment": {
    "ServerName": "localhost",
    "AllowedEnvironments": ["prod", "dev"]
  }
}
```

**`environments/prod/settings.json`**

```json
{
  "ServerName": "localhost",
  "ConnectionString": "Server=localhost;Database=prod;Trusted_Connection=True;Connection Timeout=5;TrustServerCertificate=true;"
}
```

### 3. Define Your Endpoints

Endpoints are configured as JSON files. Each type has its own directory and format, making them easy to manage and extend.

#### SQL Endpoint ‚Äî `endpoints/SQL/Products/entity.json`

Exposes a SQL table with restricted columns and CRUD operations.

```json
{
  "DatabaseObjectName": "Items",
  "DatabaseSchema": "dbo",
  "PrimaryKey": "ItemCode",
  "AllowedColumns": ["ItemCode", "Description", "Assortment", "sysguid"],
  "AllowedEnvironments": ["prod", "dev"]
}
```

#### Proxy Endpoint ‚Äî `endpoints/Proxy/Accounts/entity.json`

Acts as a reverse proxy for internal services with full method control.

```json
{
  "Url": "http://localhost:8020/services/Exact.Entity.REST.EG/Account",
  "Methods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "MERGE"],
  "AllowedEnvironments": ["prod", "dev"]
}
```

#### Composite Endpoint ‚Äî `endpoints/Proxy/SalesOrder/entity.json`

Combines multiple calls into a single logical transaction for APIs requiring sequential or nested operations.

```json
{
  "Type": "Composite",
  "Url": "http://localhost:8020/services/Exact.Entity.REST.EG",
  "Methods": ["POST"],
  "CompositeConfig": {
    "Name": "SalesOrder",
    "Description": "Creates a complete sales order with multiple lines and header",
    "Steps": [
      {
        "Name": "CreateOrderLines",
        "Endpoint": "SalesOrderLine",
        "Method": "POST",
        "IsArray": true,
        "ArrayProperty": "Lines",
        "TemplateTransformations": {
          "TransactionKey": "$guid"
        }
      },
      {
        "Name": "CreateOrderHeader",
        "Endpoint": "SalesOrderHeader",
        "Method": "POST",
        "SourceProperty": "Header",
        "TemplateTransformations": {
          "TransactionKey": "$prev.CreateOrderLines.0.d.TransactionKey"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Static Endpoint ‚Äî `endpoints/Static/ProductionMachine/entity.json`

Serves static content (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.) with optional OData filtering support.

```json
{
  "ContentType": "application/xml",
  "ContentFile": "summary.xml",
  "EnableFiltering": true,
  "AllowedEnvironments": ["prod", "dev"]
}
```

#### Files Endpoint ‚Äî `endpoints/Files/Documents/entity.json`

Stores and serves files such as documents, images, or data files.

```json
{
  "StorageType": "Local",
  "BaseDirectory": "documents",
  "AllowedExtensions": [".pdf", ".docx", ".xlsx", ".txt"],
  "AllowedEnvironments": ["prod", "dev"]
}
```

#### Webhook Endpoint ‚Äî `endpoints/Webhooks/entity.json`

Used for receiving and storing webhook payloads directly into your database.

```json
{
  "DatabaseObjectName": "WebhookData",
  "DatabaseSchema": "dbo",
  "AllowedColumns": ["webhook1", "webhook2"]
}
```

### 4. Deploy

When you're ready to host your application in IIS, there are a few important things to keep in mind. If you plan to use a proxy, you'll need to configure the correct user identity to ensure everything works smoothly. Don't forget to double-check that your application pool and security settings are properly configured for production use - we're assuming you already have the fundamentals of website security covered.

> [!TIP] 
>  If you're using a **Proxy** setup, make sure you explicitly change the Application Identity. It's also worth taking some time to fine-tune your application pool and website settings to maximize uptime and strengthen your security policies. For additional guidance on security best practices, you might find [Security Headers by Probely](https://securityheaders.com/) helpful.

## üîê Auth & Security

### Token-Based Authentication

Portway uses a lightweight token-based system for authentication. Tokens are machine-bound and stored securely on disk.

```bash
üóùÔ∏è Generated token for SERVER-1: <your-token>
üíæ Saved to /tokens/SERVER-1.txt
```

Include the token in request headers, with the Bearer prefix included:

```http
Authorization: **Bearer** YOUR_TOKEN
```

> [!CAUTION] 
> The generated token files are highly sensitive and pose a significant security risk if left on disk. **Remove these files immediately after securely saving your token elsewhere.** Unauthorized access to these files can compromise your environment.

### Azure Key Vault Support

To centralize and secure configuration secrets, use Azure Key Vault. Portway can read secrets automatically by environment.

```powershell
$env:KEYVAULT_URI = "https://your-keyvault-name.vault.azure.net/"
```

Secrets format: `{env}-ConnectionString` and `{env}-ServerName`

## üì° API Examples
